# Secure Software Development Project

## Client Summary
Artemis Financial sought assistance in identifying and addressing potential security vulnerabilities within their software systems, focusing on ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive financial data.

## Security Assessment
We conducted a comprehensive vulnerability assessment, identifying and addressing various security issues in Artemis Financial's software. The emphasis on secure coding practices aimed to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and other malicious activities, adding substantial value to the company's overall cybersecurity posture.

## Challenges and Helpful Aspects
Navigating complex code structures presented challenges but proved helpful in understanding the intricacies of the software. This challenge highlighted the importance of a methodical approach to security assessment.

## Increasing Layers of Security
To enhance security layers, we implemented measures such as adopting secure communication protocols (HTTPS) and integrating a robust cryptographic hash algorithm (SHA-256). Future assessments can benefit from leveraging automated tools and threat modeling to identify and prioritize vulnerabilities.

## Functional and Secure Code
Rigorous testing and validation processes were employed to ensure both functionality and security. After refactoring the code, extensive testing, including unit testing and integration testing, was conducted to identify and rectify any newly introduced vulnerabilities.

## Resources and Tools
Industry-standard tools like OWASP Dependency-Check and secure coding practices played a pivotal role. Future tasks can benefit from the use of static code analysis tools and continuous security monitoring.

## Showcasing Skills to Employers
This assignment demonstrates expertise in vulnerability assessment, secure coding practices, and the ability to refactor code to meet security standards. The commitment to maintaining a balance between functionality and security is evident throughout the project, showcasing a holistic approach to secure software development.
